The project ethersend is aimed at sending Ether from one account to another.

Here's how it functions:
1. When the page loads, it connects to MetaMask
2. You can fill the destination wallet with the amount of ethers to be send
3. Once proceeded it sends the ether if the right private key is provided from the provider signature.

Here are few libraries used:
1. parcel-bundler (not uploaded)
2. ethers js npm package
3. regenerator-runtime npm package
4. bootstrap/jquery (optional)
